            Alipiri – The Gateway to Tirumala
            Alipiri is the main entrance to the sacred Tirumala hills,
             home to the renowned Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Andhra Pradesh.
              Located at the foothills of Tirumala in Tirupati, Alipiri serves as the
               starting point for devotees who wish to reach the temple either by 
               road or on foot through the Alipiri Mettu trekking route. This path,
                which spans approximately 9 kilometers, is considered highly spiritual, 
                with pilgrims believing that walking up the hills cleanses their sins.
                 Alipiri is also home to the Srivari Padalu (Divine Footprints) and a security
                  checkpoint for vehicles traveling to Tirumala. With its historical and
                   religious significance, Alipiri remains an integral part of the Tirumala pilgrimage experience.

            Kalyani Dam – A Vital Water Source in Andhra Pradesh
Kalyani Dam, located near Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, is a crucial gravity dam built 
across the Swarnamukhi River. Constructed in 1977, the dam primarily serves as a water supply
 source for the city of Tirupati and its surrounding areas. Nestled in the picturesque Seshachalam
  hill ranges, the dam not only supports irrigation and drinking water needs but also acts as a serene
   tourist destination. The lush greenery around the reservoir and the peaceful environment make it a popular
    spot for nature lovers. Over the years, Kalyani Dam has played a significant role in sustaining the
     water demands of the region, especially during dry seasons.

            Seshachalam Forest – A Biodiversity Treasure in Andhra Pradesh
            The Seshachalam Forest is a vast and ecologically rich region spread across the 
            Seshachalam Hills in Andhra Pradesh. Declared a Biosphere Reserve in 2010, this forest is
             home to diverse flora and fauna, including rare and endangered species. It covers parts
              of the Chittoor and Kadapa districts and is closely associated with the Tirumala Hills,
               where the famous Tirumala Venkateswara Temple is located.
            The forest is dominated by dry deciduous and scrub vegetation, with red sanders
             (Pterocarpus santalinus) being one of its most valuable tree species, known for its
              high economic and medicinal value. The region also shelters leopards, sloth bears,
               Indian giant squirrels, and several bird species, making it a crucial area for conservation.
            Apart from its ecological significance, the Seshachalam forest holds immense 
            mythological importance in Hinduism, as it is believed to be the abode of Lord Venkateswara
            . With its breathtaking landscapes, waterfalls, and trekking trails, the forest
             attracts both nature enthusiasts and pilgrims visiting Tirumala.
